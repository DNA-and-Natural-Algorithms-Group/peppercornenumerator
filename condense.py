def condense_graph(enumerator):

    # Approach: compute SCCs using Tarjan's algorithm, including only fast 
    # 1-1 reactions as edges. For each complex in the SCC, compute the 
    # set of _fates_ of that complex (a fate is a multiset of resting states
    # that are reachable from that complex by fast reactions). For each 
    # detailed reaction, generate one condensed reaction for each combination
    # of the fates of the products.
    # 
    # Detailed description:
    # A fate of a complex is the multiset of resting states that can be reached
    # from the complex by a series of fast reactions. For instance, in the 
    # network A -> B -> C, C -> D, D -> E + F where all reactions are fast,
    # there are three resting states: ^D = { D }, ^E = { E }, ^F = { F }, and
    # the complex A has two fates: { ^D } and { ^E, ^F }. We define F(x) for 
    # some complex x to be the _set_ of fates of x; therefore 
    # F(A) = { { ^D }, { ^E, ^F } }. 
    # 
    # Relatedly, for some reaction r = (A, (b1, b2, ...)) where A is the set of 
    # reactants and B is the set of products, let the fate of the reaction
    # R(r) = F(b1) [+] F(b2) [+] ..., where [+] is the cartesian sum. Finally,
    # let S(x) be the SCC containing complex x. Note that S(x) may or may not
    # be a resting state. 
    # 
    # With these definitions, we can calculate F(x) by a recursion;
    # 
    # F(x) = { { S(x) }            : if S(x) is a resting state
    #        { U_{r in R_o} R(r)   : if S(x) is not a resting state and R_o 
    #                                represents the set of outgoing reactions
    #                                from S(x)
    # 
    # Once we have calculated F(x) (which can be done by a DFS on the DAG formed
    # by the SCCs of the fast, detailed, 1-1 reactions---see the paper for
    # details on why this forms a DAG and therefore F(x) can be calculated in
    # finite time), the set of condensed reactions can be easily computed. We
    # generate one condensed reaction for each combination of fates of the
    # products.
