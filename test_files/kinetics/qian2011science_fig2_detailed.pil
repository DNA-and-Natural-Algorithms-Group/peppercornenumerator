# This is the AND/OR gate seesaw network from Figure 2 of Qian & Winfree, Science (2011)
# but implemented explicitly using the details of clamping and extended toeholds on thresholds per figure S16.

# Enumeration explores a variety of remote-toehold-type strand displacement steps involving the 2nt clamp "c".
# These are valid, but seem to lead to some kind of infinite loop in the enumerator, 
# even when started with just the "sumgate" by itself.
