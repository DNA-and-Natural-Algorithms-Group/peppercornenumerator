length t = 10
length A = 17
length s = 2
length p = 1
length d = 15
length r = 12

input1 = t s A

# the five resulting reactions look right, although simulator thinks rates should be much faster with toehold length 10.
#
# unfortunately, when I reduce the length of toehold t to 4, we get a numerical error during the condensation step.
