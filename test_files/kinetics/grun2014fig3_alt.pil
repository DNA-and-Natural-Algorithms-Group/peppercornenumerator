# Figure 3 of Grun et al 2014 (The Peppercorn Paper)
#
# Domain representation for catalytic formation of 3-arm junction, from
# Yin, Choi, Calvert, Pierce, "Progamming Biomolecular Self-Assembly Pathways", Nature (2008)
#
# Figure 3 Grun et al uses numbered domains instead of alphabetical, and adds some extra domains.
# And that's what we do here too.
#
# In the experiments of Yin et al, every domain is 6nt.  
# That is the default for Peppercorn toeholds, but all those ^'s are ugly, so we'll list them anyway.
