length s = 2
length p = 1

# the five resulting reactions look right, although simulator thinks rates should be much faster with toehold length 10.
# i.e. Peppercorn predicts 3x10^6 /M/s instead of 4x10^4.
#
# we could follow the mysterious 2/3 equivalent toehold length formula from the genot2011fig4b.pil analysis,
# in which case we would use t=6 above.  remarkably, that gives input + substrate reacting at 7.5x10^4, off by just x2.
