# Figure 2 of Xi Chen, JACS 2012, Expanding the rule set of DNA circuitry with associative toehold activation.
# TNKMg = 20 mM Tris + 140 mM NaCl + 5 mM KCl + 5 mM MgCl2 + 0.5 mM EDTA  all at 37 C  (plus 1 uM carrier dT21), pH 7.5
#
# values read "by eye" from figure 2:
#
# for direct associative toeholds (1 stem, 0 bases in intervening loop)
# toehold lengths 8, 10, 14 give second order bimolecular rate constants 6x10^2, 8x10^3, 1x10^5 /M/s (w/o 2nt spacer)
#
# for bulged associative toeholds (1 stem, 2 bases in intervening loop)
# toehold lengths 8, 10, 14 give second order bimolecular rate constants 3x10^3, 5x10^4, 2x10^5 /M/s (w/ 2nt spacer)
#
# compared to regular toehold-mediated strand displacement (0 stems, 0 bases)
# toehold length 8 gives second order bimolecular rate constants 2x10^5 /M/s 
#
# these experimental results are at 37 C, in a less stabilizing buffer, while our rate formulas are for 25 C in a stronger buffer.
# it might make sense, therefore, to approximate T = 8 @ 37C using T = 5 @ 25 C, for which the model gives regular displacement 5x10^5 /M/s.  
# Similarly, 6 and 8 as 25C equivalents for the 10 and 14 at 37C cases.
# But since we don't know branch migration and initiation rates at 37C, this is a shot in the dark.

# this generates a lot of detailed reactions, but the condensed reactions seem plausible, 
# other than the remote toehold slowdown not being enough using the original toehold lengths.
# so, we will change to use T=5, or T=6, or T=8, above.
#
# for the associative toehold reactions, the bulged case works out well after "toehold length conversion":
#  2x10^3 (model T=5) vs 3x10^3 (exp T=8), 3x10^4 (model T=6) vs 5x10^4 (exp T=10), 2x10^6 (model T=8) vs 2x10^5 (exp T=14)
# for the "direct" case, the enumerator model doesn't predict the experimentally observed 2x to 5x slowdown; in fact it slightly speeds up.
#
# that's generally good, but there is a lot of the combinatorics prior to condensation (due to the hairpin opening?)
# and some "slow reaction" rates go negative during the condensation, even when only one invader strand is used.  (e.g. for T=5 and T=6)
#
# so (a) there is a numerics issue, and (b) we might want to have a different release-cutoff for 1-1 and 1-2 reactions.
#
# overall conclusion is that the remote-toehold initiation rate formula is not ridiculously bad.  
# we could consider special-casing some slow-down for non-bulged intiation, but this is just one of a thousand special cases
# where the domain-level model is too simple to be very accurate.
