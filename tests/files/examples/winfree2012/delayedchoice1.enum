# Example of strand displacement on a bulged duplex that yields a single-stranded species that can fold up two ways.
# The resting state complexes look right, but two structures are named "substrate".
# The transient complexes are too many to check, but two of them are both called "4".
# Condensing the reactions appears to hang.
