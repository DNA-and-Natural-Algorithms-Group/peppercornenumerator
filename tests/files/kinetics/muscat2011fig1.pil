# enumerates "correctly" with all lengths being the default 12 (i.e. comment out all the length statements above.)
# however, this results in an irreversible reaction between 
# the fuel and the moved_robot via domain Y1.

# even so, numerics go negative when condensing.

# if the actual lengths are used, it seems to hit an infinite loop (with default release cutoff 6)
# even though this does not eliminate the spurious irreversible reaction.

# with release cutoff 7, too many reactions are produced, but this completes, and gives positive condensed rates:
