# Various examples that have been enumerated using peppercorn.

Help with cleaning up this directory would be greatly appreciated. For example,
in form of a unified naming scheme or directory structure that helps to find
those system specifications in DSD literature. 

Also, many of the examples here have been used to test this software at an early
stage, so the comments may not be up do date.  Any new comments should include
the current version number of Peppercorn.
