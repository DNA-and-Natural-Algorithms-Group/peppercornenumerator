# ss-ss remote toeholds from Genot et al 2011, figure 4b (other panels can be done similarly)
# buffer: TE + 12.5 mM Mg at 25 C and pH 8.0 (paper does not mention carrier DNA)
#
# panel a:  t = 9 or 11.  s = 0.  kinetics saturated at 3x10^6 /M/s and toehold binding is essentially irreversible.
# panel b:  t = 9 or 11.  s = 1.  roughly estimate k = 8x10^5 /M/s and 3x10^6 /M/s respectively (approx 4-fold slowdown).
# panel c:  t = 6.  s=0.  roughly estimate k = 7x10^4 /M/s.  (Zhang & Winfree params give 2x10^6 for n=6, 5x10^4 for n=4.)
# panel d:  with t=14, these are all rate-limited by the unimolecular step, and thus not compatible with our condensation assumptions.

# note that since the enumerator uses Zhang & Winfree parameters, the equivalent toehold lengths for panel b would be 6 and 7.
# there is little clear justification for this, other than mysteriously Genot has a slow 6nt toehold rate, 
# so we multiply all toehold lengths by 2/3.

length d = 8  # d + t = 14 for full substrate toehold
length t = 6
length b = 22
length s = 1
invading = t b
remote_substrate = b( + ) s t* d*
proximal_substrate = b( + ) t* d*

# ../../enumerator.py genot2011fig4b.pil --release-cutoff 8 -c
#
# changing t to 6 and 7 gives 1.5x10^5 /M/s and 1.2x10^6 /M/s respectively for the remote substate (s==1).
# respectively 1.6x10^6 /M/s and 2.1x10^6 /M/s for the proximal substrate (s==0).
# that is, for the shorter toehold, we get a 10-fold slowdown in the model, compared to a 4-fold slowdown in the experiments.
