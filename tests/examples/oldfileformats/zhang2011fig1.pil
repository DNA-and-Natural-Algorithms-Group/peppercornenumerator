# this does fine with and without -c, but no net reaction occurs, but that's correct for the low-concentration limit
# ../../enumerator.py --release-cutoff 8 zhang2011fig1.pil -r 

# this creates some additional resting state complexes, and thus enables the desired multistep pathway for cooperative hybridization.

# works fine with or without -c
