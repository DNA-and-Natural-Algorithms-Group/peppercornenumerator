# Thresholding demonstration circuit from Seelig et al, Science 2006, Figure 2c
# Encoded for the enumerator by E. Winfree 6/26/2012

# Using lowercase for toeholds and short domains; uppercase for longer domains.
# Domain lengths agree with those in the paper; domain names are new since none were used in the paper.
# Note that we assume the enumerator is case-sensitive.
domain a : 6
domain b : 6
domain c : 3
domain D : 27
domain e : 3
domain E : 12
domain f : 6
domain g : 6
domain H : 15
domain i : 6
domain J : 24
domain k : 6
domain L : 15

# Strand names are identical to those in the paper.  
strand A_out = k i H e f g L
strand Th2_in = i* J* g*
strand Th1_short = g* f* e* H* i*
strand Th2 = H e f g J i
strand Th1 = g* f* e* H* i* J*
strand Th_out = H a b c E e f g
strand P_f = f* e* E* c* b* a*
strand Q_out = a b c D E e

# Only the initial complexes that were put in the test tube are defined.  (Shown in Figure 2c.)
# The rest must be enumerated.  (Almost: for convenience, we add the intermediate and output signals.)
