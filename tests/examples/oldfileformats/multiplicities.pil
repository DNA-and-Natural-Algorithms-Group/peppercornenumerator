# looks like it's not correct for kinetics.  sym should react twice as fast as asym, i.e. the sum of the two symtails reactions.

# but if we're happy with factors of two...

# Note: do not use condensation on this example.  no reactions are produced.  
# this is correct behavior:  the initial complexes are not resting complexes,
# and none of the resting complexes that result from their decomposition can react.
