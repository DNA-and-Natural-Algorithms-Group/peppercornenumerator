# Figure 3 of Grun et al 2014 (The Peppercorn Paper)

# Domain representation for catalytic formation of 3-arm junction, exactly as shown in figure 2 of
# Yin, Choi, Calvert, Pierce, "Progamming Biomolecular Self-Assembly Pathways", Nature (2008)
#
# (Figure 3 Grun et al uses numbered domains instead of alphabetical, and is somewhat different)
#
# In the experiments of Yin et al, every domain is 6nt.  
# That is the default for Peppercorn toeholds, but all those ^'s are ugly, so we'll list them anyway.

# this is because, in fact, hairpin hybridization is reversible and thus is transient in the low concentration limit
