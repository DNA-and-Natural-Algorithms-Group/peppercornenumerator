# def find_on_loop(reactant, start_loc, direction, filter):
# 	"""
# 	Finds the next domain within `reactant` that's on the same inner loop as 
# 	`start_loc` and matches the passed `filter` function. Looks in either the 
# 	5'->3' (+1) or 3'->5' (-1) `direction`.  

# 	Filter should accept the following arguments and return True or False:
# 		-	dom (utils.Domain) : the domain at `loc`
# 		-	struct (tuple or None): a (strand index, domain index) pair 
# 			indicating what `dom` is bound to, or None if `dom` is unpaired.
# 		-	loc (tuple) : a (strand index, domain index) pair
# 		-       Note that while every single-stranded domain is tested,
# 		        only the "first" domain of a stem helix (in the direction of 
# 			search) will be passed to the filter.


# 	Returns an array of tuples: `(loc, before, after)`, where:
# 		-	`loc` is a (strand index, domain index) pair indicating the 
# 			position of the matched domain
# 		-	`before` is a list of (domain, struct, loc) triples giving the 
# 			domains after `start_loc` but before the matched domain on the loop
# 			(or None instead of triple where there is a break in the loop)
# 		-	`after` is a list of (domain, struct, loc) triples giving the 
# 			domains after the matched domain but before `start_loc` on the loop
# 			(or None instead of triple where there is a break in the loop)

# 	Where a loop involves stems, only one of the complementary domains will be 
# 	listed in the array of tuples, specifically, the "first" one in the search 
# 	direction. Thus, a multiloop with n unpaired domains and m stems will 
# 	result, for closed loops, in `len(before+after) == n+m-2`, as the match 
# 	location and `start_loc` are omitted.

# 	`before` and `after` are converted to Loop objects (see utils.py) prior 
# 	to being returned, so that the number of bases and number of stems and 
# 	open/closed status is readily accessible.

# 	Note 1: `before` and `after` refer to the partial loops between `start_loc` 
# 	and each of the results, _in the `direction`_ of the search. For example:
  
#            A
# 	      ____
# 	     /    \ 
# 	 x  |     |  x*
# 	    |
# 	     \____> 3'

# 	        B

# 	If `start_loc` pointed to `x` and `direction` is +1, then `before` would 
# 	be `A` and `after` would be `B`. If instead `direction` is -1, then 
# 	`before` is `B` and `after` is `A`. 

# 	Note 2: If the domain passed to `start_loc` is a duplex, the results may 
# 	be unexpected:

# 	       ___  x  ___
# 	5' ___/   \___/   \___  
# 	3' ___  A  ___  B  ___)
# 	      \___/   \___/
# 	            x*

# 	Notice that the duplex x() participates in two internal loops (A and B). 
# 	By convention, the internal loop considered is the _internal loop which

def find_on_loop(reactant, start_loc, direction, filter):
	"""
	Finds the next domain within `reactant` that's on the same inner loop as 
	`start_loc` and matches the passed `filter` function. Looks in either the 
	5'->3' (+1) or 3'->5' (-1) `direction`.  

	Filter should accept the following arguments and return True or False:
		-	dom (utils.Domain) : the domain at `loc`
		-	struct (tuple or None): a (strand index, domain index) pair 
			indicating what `dom` is bound to, or None if `dom` is unpaired.
		-	loc (tuple) : a (strand index, domain index) pair
		-       Note that while every single-stranded domain is tested,
		        only the "first" domain of a stem helix (in the direction of 
			search) will be passed to the filter.


	Returns an array of tuples: `(loc, before, after)`, where:
		-	`loc` is a (strand index, domain index) pair indicating the 
			position of the matched domain
		-	`before` is a list of (domain, struct, loc) triples giving the 
			domains after `start_loc` but before the matched domain on the loop
			(or None instead of triple where there is a break in the loop)
		-	`after` is a list of (domain, struct, loc) triples giving the 
			domains after the matched domain but before `start_loc` on the loop
			(or None instead of triple where there is a break in the loop)

	Where a loop involves stems, only one of the complementary domains will be 
	listed in the array of tuples, specifically, the "first" one in the search 
	direction. Thus, a multiloop with n unpaired domains and m stems will 
	result, for closed loops, in `len(before+after) == n+m-2`, as the match 
	location and `start_loc` are omitted.

	`before` and `after` are converted to Loop objects (see utils.py) prior 
	to being returned, so that the number of bases and number of stems and 
	open/closed status is readily accessible.

	Note 1: `before` and `after` refer to the partial loops between `start_loc` 
	and each of the results, _in the `direction`_ of the search. For example:
  
           A
	      ____
	     /    \ 
	 x  |     |  x*
	    |
	     \____> 3'

	        B

	If `start_loc` pointed to `x` and `direction` is +1, then `before` would 
	be `A` and `after` would be `B`. If instead `direction` is -1, then 
	`before` is `B` and `after` is `A`. 

	Note 2: If the domain passed to `start_loc` is a duplex, the results may 
	be unexpected:

	       ___  x  ___
	5' ___/   \___/   \___  
	3' ___  A  ___  B  ___)
	      \___/   \___/
	            x*

	Notice that the duplex x() participates in two internal loops (A and B). 
	By convention, the internal loop considered is the _internal loop which
	encloses this domain_. That means if you pass domain x and +1, you'll get
	loop A, whereas if you pass x and -1, you'll get loop B. This is in an
	attempt to be consistent with the case where you pass an unpaired domain
	(and therefore the internal loop searched is the one which encloses the 
	unpaired domain).
