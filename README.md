% Domain-level Reaction Enumerator
% Karthik Sarma, Casey Grun, and Erik Winfree.

Overview
--------

This package predicts the set of possible reactions between a set of initial nucleic acid complexes. Complexes are comprised of strands, which are subdivided into "domains"---contiguous regions of nucleotide bases which participate in Watson-Crick hybridization. The enumerator only considers reactions between complexes with complementary domains. At this point, only unpseudoknotted intermediate complexes are considered.

This package is written for Python 2.7; Python must be installed and in the user's `path` in order to run the program. 

Usage
-----

	usage: enumerator.py [-h] [--infile INPUT_FILENAME]
	                     [--outfile OUTPUT_FILENAME] [-o OUTPUT_FORMAT]
	                     [-i INPUT_FORMAT] [-c]
	                     [--max-complex-size MAX_COMPLEX_SIZE]
	                     [--max-complexes MAX_COMPLEX_COUNT]
	                     [--max-reactions MAX_REACTION_COUNT]

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --infile INPUT_FILENAME
	                        Path to the input file
	  --outfile OUTPUT_FILENAME
	                        Path to the output file
	  -o OUTPUT_FORMAT      Desired format for the output file
	  -i INPUT_FORMAT       Desired format for the input file
	  -c                    Condense reactions into only resting complexes
	  --max-complex-size MAX_COMPLEX_SIZE
	                        Maximum number of strands allowed in a complex (used
	                        to prevent polymerization)
	  --max-complexes MAX_COMPLEX_COUNT
	                        Maximum number of complexes that may be enumerated
	                        before the enumerator halts.
	  --max-reactions MAX_REACTION_COUNT
	                        Maximum number of reactions that may be enumerated
	                        before the enumerator halts.


Building documentation
----------------------

Documentation is built from comments in the source using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/); Sphinx must be installed. Then you can run:

	make docs

from within the main directory to build HTML documentation. Additional output formats are available, and can be generated by moving to the `docs/` subdirectory and using `make`. Type `make` to show a list of available output formats.

Running unit tests
------------------

Unit tests for the project are written using [Nosetests](https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/). Nosetests must be installed. Then you can run:

	make tests

from within the main directory to run unit tests.
